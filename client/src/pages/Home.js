            This site offers a browsable collection of Beanie Babies and their associated meta-data. For more information on the project please read the <Link to="/about">About page</Link>.

        </p>
        <p>Currently, this site offers limited search capabilities. Hopefully in the coming months this will be developed further to include search by Zodiac Sign, Birthday and other meta-data fields.</p>
